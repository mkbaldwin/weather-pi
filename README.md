# weather-pi

A simple Kotlin application to accept weather data and submit to an InfluxDB
database. This code specifically was written to accept data from 
[rtl_433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433) SDR and an Acurite 
weather station. Currently this has only been tested using protocol
40 for the Acurite-5n1 weather station, but should be able to be
adapted to others if needed.
